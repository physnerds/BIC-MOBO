# Introduction
This is the forked repository. The main difference is that it comes with the epic detector configuration files.

The idea is that you clone this repository. Use an appropriate eic container image in the cvmfs for the simulation for the PanDA jobs.

Run the scheduler_epic optimization to schedule the PanDA jobs of simulation and analysis. 

# Create a conda environment to install everything needed.
You can directly follow the instructions from the README.md. Check for the consistencies in the ax-platform versions, numpy etc.

# Using the cvmfs container image 
The container by itself is in the run_singularity.sh file. Make sure it points to the correct container.
 
# Binding of the paths in the run_singularity.sh and make sure that the path points to the epic executables.

# Make sure that you copy the thisepic.sh from the cvmfs to local area if running locally
Edit the DETECTOR_PATH such that they point to the xml files generated by BIC-MOBO. 
# Adding the additional packages

# Install ax version 1.0.0 on the container
pip install --target=$AIDE_WORKDIR ax-platform==1.0.0


## TO PANDA Running
# Basic ingredients needed
1. Global parameters
2. objective functions
3. Mapping of the objective functions
